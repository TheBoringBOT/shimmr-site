This data is completely anonymous, meaning it cannot be traced back to an individual user, device, or account.

## Analytics Tools

We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous data. Firebase Analytics helps us understand app usage patterns and improve features. No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected through Firebase.
