      <h2 class={styles.sectionHeading}>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Shimmr was created by an audio engineer and software developer who shared a vision: to build
        a beautiful, high-quality sound experience that supports real mental and emotional benefits.
        The name Shimmr comes from the idea of shimmering — the subtle, glowing feeling often
        experienced in deep meditation or moments of calm clarity. That sensation became the
        foundation for what the app aims to deliver through sound.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built in Stockholm, Sweden, Shimmr combines Scandinavian design principles of simplicity and
        functionality with cutting-edge audio technology to create an experience that's both
        beautiful and effective.
      </p>

      <h2 class={styles.sectionHeading}>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Every element in Shimmr — from the layered tones to the minimal design — was crafted from
        the ground up. The audio is based on research-backed frequencies and sound therapy
        principles, combining binaural beats, isochronic tones, ambient textures, and nature
        soundscapes to support sleep, reduce stress, improve focus, and deepen meditation.
      </p>

      <h2 class={styles.sectionHeading}>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        The long-term goal is to continue evolving Shimmr into the most versatile and customizable
        sound-based wellness platform — one that remains simple to use, beautiful to experience, and
        powerful enough to support real change in your daily life.
